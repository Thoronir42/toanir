                    As I lacked in organization, lots of aspects of my life rusted and got overgrown by weeds. This
                    means for example that projects and ideas of things to do kept piling up without me ever giving
                    them attention. This organizational junk tend to get overwhelming and so I try to regularly
                    evaluate whether a project is still interesting to me and my future.

                    My poor time-management and clouded prioritisation lead to me to a rather uncomfortable
                    place where I was juggling time between two clients, later to be joined by another. Among
                    these, I've also went crazy with coding ideas and fun tools. With all of this, I started
                    to really feel the importance of the life in work-life balance - without it, one doesn't
                    really have a fuel for the work.

                    This year I exchanged a stagnating job for a self-employment and client-oriented project work.
                    Between the lines I also started welcoming conflicts in the meaning of obstacles and since then
                    I try to respect the nature of conflicts in hopes to make them constructive. In short, the core
                    of a conflict is misalignment of interests, experiences and/or understanding. Unless resolved
                    a conflict can grow into something much worse.
